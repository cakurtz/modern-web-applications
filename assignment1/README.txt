comments: Possible variations in output: (1) Everything is converted to lower case, even in error messages, (2) URLs that cause errors are not displayed in history, but URLs that are valid and have additional parameters or nonsense are fully displayed with the additional stuff in history, (3) Console prints out stack trace each time an incorrect query is submitted (done in JSoupHandler provided in example code).
